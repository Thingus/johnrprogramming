## About

The source code for my personal webpage; including the frontpage, my CV and whatever else I think is a good idea going forwards. This is statically built with Next and hosted on Github pages.
This page is part of a small set of repos; I keep my CV in markdown and have a few Jinja templates to render it into basic HTML, a React page (seen here), and various other formats. I also keep the Rust-built WASM component that makes up the backdrop in its own repo, and the build artefacts are pushed to thingus.github.io for hosting.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
